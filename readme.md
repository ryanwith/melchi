# Melchi

## Overview  ðŸ“š

Melchi is a Snowflake to DuckDB replication tool that handles both initial data ingestion and continuous updates through CDC (Change Data Capture). It gives you a local, synchronized copy of your Snowflake data without the overhead of managing complex ETL processes.

Here's how Melchi works:

1. You provide a list of Snowflake tables you want to replicate.
2. Run the setup command in the terminal.
3. Melchi automatically:
   - Creates equivalent tables in DuckDB based on your Snowflake table schemas
   - Sets up streams and change tracking tables in Snowflake for each replicated table
   - Creates change tracking tables in DuckDB to monitor update times

Once set up, simply run the `sync_data` command whenever you need to update. Melchi efficiently checks Snowflake for inserts, updates, and deletes, and applies these changes to DuckDB.

All you need to do is set up a role in Snowflake with the appropriate permissions. Melchi handles the rest, providing a low-maintenance, efficient solution for keeping your DuckDB instance in sync with Snowflake.

## Usage

[Add usage instructions here]

## Configuration

Melchi uses a YAML configuration file to manage connections and specify which tables to replicate. Follow these steps to set up your configuration:

1. Create a `config.yaml` file in the config folder in the root directory.

2. Add the following sections to your `config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   source:
     type: snowflake
     account: ${SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER}
     user: ${SNOWFLAKE_USER}
     password: ${SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD}
     role: snowflake_role_to_use
     warehouse: snowflake_warehouse_to_use
     change_tracking_database: database_with_change_tracking_schema
     change_tracking_schema: name_of_change_tracking_schema

   target:
     type: duckdb
     database: /path/to/your/local/duckdb/database.duckdb
     change_tracking_schema: name_of_change_tracking_schema

   tables_config:
     path: "path/to/your/tables_to_transfer.csv"
   ```

   Replace placeholders with your actual Snowflake and DuckDB details.

3. Create a `tables_to_transfer.csv` (or other name you specify in the config) file in the `config` directory to specify which tables to replicate:

   ```csv
   database,schema,table,cdc_type
   your_db,your_schema,table1,full_refresh
   your_db,your_schema,table2,standard_stream
   your_db,your_schema,table3,append_only_stream
   ```

   The `cdc_type` column specifies how changes should be tracked for each table:
   - `full_refresh`: Completely refreshes the table in DuckDB with each sync by dropping and recreating it.  This is the default if no cdc_type is specified.
   - `standard_stream`: Uses Snowflake's standard streams to capture inserts, updates, and deletes.
   - `append_only_stream`: Uses Snowflake's append-only streams for insert-only tables (more efficient for append-only data).

4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER=your_account
   SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
   SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
   DUCKDB_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/your/duckdb/database.db
   ```

Ensure all configuration files are properly set up before running Melchi.  Note.  If you do not have a duckdb database file, Melchi will create one at the path you specify.

## Permissions

To use Melchi effectively, you need to set up the correct permissions in Snowflake. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a dedicated role in Snowflake for Melchi:

   ```sql
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
   CREATE ROLE melchi_role;
   ```

2. Grant the necessary permissions to this role. You can do this manually or use Melchi's `generate_source_sql` feature to help you.

### Manual Permission Setup

If you prefer to set up permissions manually, you need to grant the following:

- Usage on the warehouse
- Usage on the databases and schemas containing the tables you want to replicate
- Select permission on the tables you want to replicate
- Create Table and Create Stream permissions on the change tracking schema

For example:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE your_warehouse TO ROLE melchi_role;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE your_db TO ROLE melchi_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA your_db.your_schema TO ROLE melchi_role;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE your_db.your_schema.your_table TO ROLE melchi_role;
GRANT CREATE TABLE, CREATE STREAM ON SCHEMA change_tracking_db.change_tracking_schema TO ROLE melchi_role;
```

### Using generate_permissions

Melchi provides a `generate_permissions` feature to help you create the necessary SQL statements for setting up permissions. To use it:

1. Ensure your `config.yaml` and `tables_to_transfer.csv` are correctly set up.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py generate_permissions
   ```

3. This will generate a file named `source_setup.sql` in the `output` directory. Review this file to ensure it meets your security requirements.

4. Execute the SQL statements in the generated file in your Snowflake account to set up the permissions.

Remember to enable change tracking on the tables you want to replicate:

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_db.your_schema.your_table SET CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE;
```

By following these steps, you'll have the necessary permissions set up in Snowflake for Melchi to operate effectively.

## Usage

Melchi provides several commands to manage your data synchronization process. Here's how to use each of them:

### 1. Generate Source SQL

Before you start using Melchi, you need to set up the necessary permissions and change tracking in Snowflake. Use the following command to generate the required SQL:

```bash
python main.py generate_source_sql --config path/to/your/config.yaml --output path/to/output/directory
```

This will create a `source_setup.sql` file in the specified output directory. Review this file and execute the SQL statements in your Snowflake environment.

### 2. Setup

To initialize Melchi and prepare both your source (Snowflake) and target (DuckDB) for data synchronization, run:

```bash
python main.py setup --config path/to/your/config.yaml
```

This command will:
- Set up change data capture (CDC) in Snowflake for the specified tables
- Create corresponding tables in DuckDB
- Initialize change tracking metadata

### 3. Sync Data

To synchronize data from Snowflake to DuckDB, use:

```bash
python main.py sync_data --config path/to/your/config.yaml
```

This command will:
- Check for changes in the Snowflake tables since the last synchronization
- Apply those changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to the corresponding DuckDB tables

### Best Practices

1. **Initial Setup**: Always run the `setup` command before your first `sync_data` operation.

2. **Regular Syncing**: Set up a scheduled job to run the `sync_data` command at regular intervals to keep your DuckDB instance up-to-date.

3. **Configuration Updates**: If you modify your `config.yaml` or `tables_to_transfer.csv`, re-run the `setup` command to ensure all necessary changes are applied.

4. **Error Handling**: If a `sync_data` operation fails, address the error and re-run the command. Melchi is designed to pick up where it left off.

5. **Monitoring**: Regularly check the Melchi logs to ensure smooth operation and to catch any potential issues early.

### Example Workflow

1. Set up your configuration files (`config.yaml` and `tables_to_transfer.csv`).
2. Generate and execute the source SQL:
   ```bash
   python main.py generate_source_sql --config config/config.yaml --output sql_output
   ```
3. Review and execute the `sql_output/source_setup.sql` in Snowflake.
4. Run the initial setup:
   ```bash
   python main.py setup --config config/config.yaml
   ```
5. Perform your first data sync:
   ```bash
   python main.py sync_data --config config/config.yaml
   ```
6. Set up a cron job or scheduled task to run the sync_data command at your desired frequency.

By following these steps and best practices, you'll be able to efficiently manage your data synchronization process with Melchi.

## How Melchi Works

Melchi uses a combination of Snowflake's change tracking features and custom metadata tables to efficiently synchronize data from Snowflake to DuckDB. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

### CDC Strategies

Melchi supports three different CDC (Change Data Capture) strategies that you can specify for each table in your `tables_to_transfer.csv` file:

1. **Full Refresh** (`full_refresh`)
   - Simplest strategy - drops and recreates the DuckDB table during each sync
   - Best for:
     - Initial testing and setup
     - Small lookup tables
     - When you want to avoid setting up change tracking in Snowflake
   - Trade-off: Resource-intensive for large tables due to complete reload

2. **Standard Stream** (`standard_stream`)
   - Uses Snowflake's standard streams to capture all changes (inserts, updates, and deletes)
   - Best for:
     - Large tables where full refresh would be inefficient
     - Data requiring complete change history (inserts, updates, deletes)
     - Tables with frequent modifications
   - Limitations:
     - Cannot be used with tables containing geography or geometry columns
     - Requires change tracking setup in Snowflake

3. **Append-Only Stream** (`append_only_stream`)
   - Uses Snowflake's append-only streams to capture only new records
   - Best for:
     - Log tables
     - Event data
     - Any table where records are only inserted, never updated or deleted
   - Most efficient option for append-only data patterns

### Setup Process

#### 1. Snowflake Setup (for `standard_stream` and `append_only_stream` tables)

When you run the `setup` command, Melchi creates three components in Snowflake for each table:

1. **Change Tracking**: Enables change tracking on the source table
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE your_db.your_schema.your_table SET CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE;
   ```

2. **Stream**: Creates a stream to capture changes
   ```sql
   CREATE STREAM your_db.change_tracking_schema.stream_your_table ON TABLE your_db.your_schema.your_table;
   ```

3. **Processing Table**: Creates a staging area for captured changes
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE your_db.change_tracking_schema.stream_your_table_processing LIKE your_db.your_schema.your_table;
   ```

#### 2. DuckDB Setup

For all CDC strategies, Melchi:
1. Creates tables that mirror your Snowflake schema
2. Sets up metadata tables to track synchronization status
3. For tables without primary keys, adds a `melchi_row_id` column to uniquely identify rows

### Synchronization Process

When you run `sync_data`, Melchi handles each table according to its CDC strategy:

#### For `full_refresh` Tables:
- Drops and recreates the table with fresh data from Snowflake
- Updates synchronization metadata

#### For `standard_stream` and `append_only_stream` Tables:
1. Captures changes from Snowflake streams into processing tables
2. Converts changes to pandas DataFrames for processing
3. Applies changes to DuckDB:
   - `standard_stream`: Handles inserts, updates, and deletes
   - `append_only_stream`: Handles only inserts
4. Updates synchronization metadata
5. Cleans up processing tables

### Implementation Details

#### Naming Conventions
- Snowflake streams: `change_tracking_schema.stream_[database]$[schema]$[table]`
- Snowflake processing tables: `change_tracking_schema.stream_[database]$[schema]$[table]_processing`
- DuckDB tables: Mirror the original Snowflake table names

#### Key Features
- All CDC strategies provide accurate data as of their last sync time
- Tables without primary keys automatically get a `melchi_row_id` column added
- Uses Snowflake's native change tracking capabilities for efficient syncing
- Supports mixing different CDC strategies across tables based on your needs

#### Current Limitations
- Geography and Geometry columns not supported with `standard_stream`
- Primary keys must be defined in Snowflake (or a `melchi_row_id` will be added)
- All tables must be replaced together when modifying the transfer configuration
